# Review

- "Full-stack" combines both frontend and backend of a web application
   - can build complete apps from start to finish
   - often handles APIs, auth, databases and deployment
- List some of the various tech-stacks for web dev.  Which one will we be using?
- Read ["Manifesto for Agile Software Development"](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

# Refactor App v.3
Use what you will learn here to help build your mid-term

Initialize a new Node.js project set up with all folders, routes, controllers, models etc. and any other necessary components

- `npm init -y`
- `npm i connect-mongo cookie-parser dotenv ejs express express-session express-validator mongoose morgan passport passport-local-mongoose github-slugger connect-flash`
- `npm i -D nodemon`
- edit `package.json`
   - insert under scripts, `"start": "nodemon index.js"`
   - we'll use ES import way, so add `"type": "module",`
